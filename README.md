# MarchingCubes
An implemention of parallel marching cubes algorithm by CUDA

Original Paper: Parallel Marching Blocks: A Practical Isosurfacing Algorithm for Large Data on Many-Core Architectures\\
The first step (block-based-stream-reduction) reached over 10x speed up (the iso-surface is calculated realtime, not read from textrue)
